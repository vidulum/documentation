## Validator Migration to New Server

**What is validator migration?**

Validator migration is a process of assuming validator role on new node.
That will turn new full node into validator. This process is important part of providing infrastructure services for Vidulum chain.


**When validator needs to be migrated?**

Here is few situations which might required validation service to be moved:
 - Server ran out of resources and can't be expanded - move to new server required
 - System crashed and needs to be reinstalled - fresh start
 - Maintenance of current system and validation service will be moved to backup node for that period


::: tip NOTE:
Please follow migration steps very carefuly. If you are not sure about certain steps or need more clarification, reach out to our validator community on Discord, please.
Be aware that running two nodes as validators with same key will lead to slashing and might lead to validator account being tombstoned.

**If you want to evaluate presented process use Vidulum Testnet, which is kept running for evaluation, testing and learning purposes.**
:::


### PART 0: Configuration files location
Configuration of node and validator is stored in
```bash
${HOME}/.vidulum/config
```

::: tip NOTE:
Same configuration files can be found on full node and on validator.
:::

When you look into that folder you will for sure find files listed below:
```bash
.vidulum/
└── config
    ├── addrbook.json
    ├── app.toml
    ├── client.toml
    ├── config.toml
    ├── genesis.json
    ├── node_key.json
    └── priv_validator_key.json
```
There might be more files, but those presented are crucial for us.


### PART 1: Steps to perform on existing validator

#### Stop and disable Vidulum service
In this step we will stop and disable existing Vidulum service.
```bash
sudo systemctl stop vidulum.service
sudo systemctl disable vidulum.service
```

To make sure that service has been stopped you can check if any new logs are generated by service
```bash
sudo journalctl -u vidulum -f
```
If there will be no new output coming on screen it means service is stopped.


#### Rename files containing validator keys
```bash
mv ${HOME}/.vidulum/config/node_key.json ${HOME}/.vidulum/config/node_key.json.validator
mv ${HOME}/.vidulum/config/priv_validator_key.json ${HOME}/.vidulum/config/priv_validator_key.json.validator
```
**NOTE:** Renaming files containing key will prevent service from accidental start, which might drive to trouble. It is not required, but highly recommended.


#### Copy validator keys to new system
In order to start another system with validator role, we need to transfer files containing keys to new system.
Presented commands are just example and in case you have different method of transferring files to destination system, please adjust steps to match your process.
```bash
scp ${HOME}/.vidulum/config/node_key.json.validator vidulum@your.new.server.ip:/home/vidulum/.vidulum/config
scp ${HOME}/.vidulum/config/priv_validator_key.json.validator vidulum@your.new.server.ip:/home/vidulum/.vidulum/config
```


### PART 2: Steps to perform on new server

::: tip NOTE:
Assumption is that new system, which will assume validator role is already configured as Vidulum full node and fully synchronized.
:::

#### Stop and disable Vidulum service
In this step we will stop and disable existing Vidulum service.
```bash
sudo systemctl stop vidulum.service
sudo systemctl disable vidulum.service
```

To make sure that service has been stopped you can check if any new logs are generated by service
```bash
sudo journalctl -u vidulum -f
```
If there will be no new output coming on screen it means service is stopped.


#### Rename files containing node keys
```bash
mv ${HOME}/.vidulum/config/node_key.json ${HOME}/.vidulum/config/node_key.json.node
mv ${HOME}/.vidulum/config/priv_validator_key.json ${HOME}/.vidulum/config/priv_validator_key.json.node
```
**NOTE:** Renaming existing keys instead of removeing them allows to revert configuration back. That is especially important if Validator role is moved to different system temporarily for maintenance purposes.


#### Enable validator keys
This step assumes that keys copied from original validator are located in Vidulum node config folder.
```bash
cp ${HOME}/.vidulum/config/node_key.json.validator ${HOME}/.vidulum/config/node_key.json
cp ${HOME}/.vidulum/config/priv_validator_key.json.validator ${HOME}/.vidulum/config/priv_validator_key.json
```


#### Restart service
All components are now in place, so it is time to start node and assume Validator role.
```bash
sudo systemctl enable vidulum.service
sudo systemctl start vidulum.service
```

First thing node will have to do is to catch-up with chain.
To check node status
```bash
curl http://localhost:26657/status
```

In output look for following line:
```bash
catching_up: false
```

If status if ***false*** it means node is fully synchronized. At that point you should see in explorer that your node start signing blocks again.

## Configuring State Sync post installation

You can use state sync to restore your database in a matter of minutes.

::: tip TIP:
Before proceeding **backup all configuration files**
:::


### Properly clean your data directory

First, as your admin user, stop the vidulum.service

```bash
sudo systemctl stop vidulum
```

It is best to start from scratch.
Continue as your `vidulum` user.

::: warning WARNING: 
This will erase your nodes database. Be sure you backed up your `config/priv_validator_key.json` and `config/node_key.json` prior to running unsafe-reset-all.
It is recommended to copy `data/priv_validator_state.json` to a backup and restore it after unsafe-reset-all to avoid potential double signing..
:::

```bash
vidulumd unsafe-reset-all
```

### Enable State Sync

In **_\${HOME}/.vidulum/config/config.toml_** find the **_[p2p]_** section, and change the following to match:

```bash
seeds = "883ec7d5af7222c206674c20c997ccc5c242b38b@ec2-3-82-120-39.compute-1.amazonaws.com:26656,eed11fff15b1eca8016c6a0194d86e4a60a65f9b@apollo.erialos.me:26656"
```

::: tip TIP: 
Do not add the seeds as persistent_peers.  If you have persistent_peers in your list and it is because of prior recommended configuration settings, now is the best time to remove them and to just use the seeds.  Or check out Sentry's and add your Sentry's now!
:::

Now find the **[statesync]** section and change the config to match the following highlighted lines:

```bash{13,25-29}

[statesync]
# State sync rapidly bootstraps a new node by discovering, fetching, and restoring a state machine
# snapshot from peers instead of fetching and replaying historical blocks. Requires some peers in
# the network to take and serve state machine snapshots. State sync is not attempted if the node

# starting from the height of the snapshot.

chunk_fetchers = "4"
```

::: tip TIP:
Don't use the above height! Get a recent block height and header hash by visiting the explorer! Snapshots are taken at 3000 block height intervals. 
:::

Save and restart the daemon.  Watch the journal log output, if everything is working you will see something like this:

```bash

Shortly after finding the best peers and repopulating the address book, you will begin to download the blockchain at a lightening speed compared to full sync!
Remember, this puts your database at a truncated state.  You will only be able to query information from the machine you apply these settings to, only at the block height that you initiated state sync at.

### Troubleshooting

Q: It continues to look for snapshots and doesn't ever provide me one
A: Check your seeds/peers. After reseting the the data dir and addressbook, you must redownload it.  If you fail to do so, it will not start state sync.

Q: Validator set is Nil??
A: See above.

Q: It's still not working and my seeds/peers are correct.
A: Try another `unsafe-reset-all` and restart.  If that does not work, change `pruning = nothing` in `app.toml` and restart the service.  State Sync will sometimes complain if you try to prune everything when it's first applying a state sync snapshot.

If you are still running into issues, come to the discord and share your log errors in the #Validator-operators channel.  It is possible for a snapshot to be stuck in creation that would prevent delivery of snapshots for statesync.

## Database Pruning

Doing less than the recommended settings here is not recommended nor supported!

Pruning your database to acheive the best minimal result will require that you first **delete** what you have and then use **state sync** to catch back up.
These are advanced instructions, continue only if you know what you are doing.

Lets also get an idea of how much disk space this has saved us.  It's important to keep track of these metrics so you can understand how well your node is performing!
```bash
df -h
du -h -d 1 /home/vidulum/.vidulum/data
```

::: tip TIP:
Before proceeding **backup all configuration files**
:::


### Prepare to prune your database

Backup your blockchain data before continuing in the event the unexpected happens.

::: warning WARNING: 
This will erase your nodes database. Be sure you backed up your `config/priv_validator_key.json` and `config/node_key.json` prior to running unsafe-reset-all.
It is recommended to copy `data/priv_validator_state.json` to a backup and restore it after unsafe-reset-all to avoid potential double signing..
:::

As your `vidulum` user:
```bash
vidulumd unsafe-reset-all
```

### Edit app.toml

Edit `app.toml` and change the `pruning` and `min-retain-blocks` settings.

```bash
nano /home/vidulum/.vidulum/config/app.toml
```

This will be the first section in app.toml, and it will contain what we need to edit:

```bash{18,54}
# This is a TOML config file.
# For more information, see https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

###############################################################################

# The minimum gas prices a validator is willing to accept for processing a
# transaction. A transaction's fees must meet the minimum of any denomination
# specified in this config (e.g. 0.25token1;0.0001token2).

# default: the last 100 states are kept in addition to every 500th state; pruning at 10 block intervals
# nothing: all historic states will be saved, nothing will be deleted (i.e. archiving node)
# everything: all saved states will be deleted, storing only the current state; pruning at 10 block intervals
# custom: allow pruning options to be manually specified through 'pruning-keep-recent', 'pruning-keep-every', and 'pruning-interval'
pruning = "everything"

# These are applied if and only if the pruning strategy is custom.
pruning-keep-recent = "0"
pruning-keep-every = "0"
pruning-interval = "0"

# HaltHeight contains a non-zero block height at which a node will gracefully

# block being committed, such that all blocks past this offset are pruned
# from Tendermint. It is used as part of the process of determining the
# ResponseCommit.RetainHeight value during ABCI Commit. A value of 0 indicates
# that no blocks should be pruned.
#
# This configuration value is only responsible for pruning Tendermint blocks.
# It has no bearing on application state pruning which is determined by the
# "pruning-*" configurations.
#
# Note: Tendermint block pruning is dependant on this parameter in conunction
# with the unbonding (safety threshold) period, state pruning and state sync
# snapshot parameters to determine the correct minimum value of
# ResponseCommit.RetainHeight.
min-retain-blocks = 210000
# ~6 Second block time -> 14400 blocks/day -> 14 days is 2/3 unbonding time
# 14*14400 = 201600 ~~ 210000 blocks should be kept!
...
..
```

### Configure State Sync if you haven't yet

[Configure State Sync](./maintenance.md#configuring-state-sync-post-installation)

::: tip TIP:
Use the explorer and choose a block height & hash within the closest 3000'th of the current block. IE: 1823000
:::

### Deploy your changes

Take this time to make any other updates during your **planed maintenance time**. After making all nessessary changes to your configuration files, save and restart the daemon.

```bash
systemctl start vidulum && journalctl -u vidulum.service -f
```

Watch your logs, ensure you are working properly again.

Check out how much space you have save from when we started!

```bash
df -h
du -h -d 1 /home/vidulum/.vidulum/data
```

## Setting up Sentry's to protect your validator/node

Sentry's are a sort of `firewall` for your validator.  There are many ways that you can setup Sentry's to hide your validator behind them.  In this example, we will just cover the most basic way.

Recommended read before proceeding:  [Sentry Node Architecture Overview](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/sentry-node-architecture-overview/454)

### Requirements

Minimum requirements:
- 1 CPU
- 1 GB Ram
- 25GB SSD/NVME Storage Space

::: tip TIP:
Before proceeding **backup all configuration files**
:::

### Setup your Sentry

::: tip TIP:
The minimum recommended number of sentry's to use per validator is 3.  Having less may actually **hurt** your validators up time.
:::

### Install Vidulum

Like all vidulum nodes, you can follow the instructions already provided to get started!
[Mainnet Full node Installation Instructions](mainnet.md#section-0-requirements)

Once you are finished with `SECTION 2` for `MAINNET` installation, make these extra configuration changes.

### Configure Pruning & State Sync

Follow the instructions to configure your Sentry for [Pruning](./maintenance.md#database-pruning) and [State Sync](./maintenance.md#configuring-state-sync-post-installation).

### Start State Sync

Now start your vidulum daemon, watch the logs, and allow your new sentry to first catch up and download the blockchain.  Once it has caught up, proceed with the next steps.

Stop your daemon:
```bash
systemctl stop vidulum
```

### Sentry Configuration

Go to your **validator**, you will need your node ID.

::: tip TIP:
Store all node ID information in a text file for easier retrieval later!
:::

```bash
vidulumd tendermint show-node-id
```

Now on your **Sentry**, edit the `config.toml` file.

The configuration options we need to change/add to are:

`persistent_peers` and `unconditional_peer_ids`

Using your node ID, you will need to configure them as such:

```bash
persistent_peers = "VALIDATOR-NODE-ID-1@IP-ADDRESS:26656,SENTRY-NODE-ID-1@IP-ADDRESS:26656,SENTRY-NODE-ID-2@IP-ADDRESS:26656,..."
...
..
...
unconditional_peer_ids = "VALIDATOR-NODE-ID-1,SENTRY-NODE-ID-1,SENTRY-NODE-ID-2,...."
...
..
..
...
private_peer_ids = "VALIDATOR-NODE-ID-1,VALIDATOR-NODE-ID-2,..."

```

The goal here is that each Sentry will list your **validator** and all other **sentry's** in the `persistent_peers` and `unconditional_peer_ids` settings.

Lastly, the `private_peer_ids` setting is to mask your validator from being gossiped.  You only want your validator found via your sentry's.

Once you have added all your Sentry and Validator node ID's to all the proper configurations, restart your Sentry's.  You want them up, caught up, and running before continuing to the next steps.

### Validator Configuration

Your validator will now need to be updated to use all of your currently running Sentry's.
The same idea here applies as the above configuration.  You need to add all your sentry's to the `config.toml` and change the number of allowed connected peers to zero.

```bash
seeds = ""
...
..
...
persistent_peers = "SENTRY-NODE-ID-1@IP-ADDRESS:26656,SENTRY-NODE-ID-2@IP-ADDRESS:26656,..."
...
..
...
unconditional_peer_ids = "SENTRY-NODE-ID-1,SENTRY-NODE-ID-2,...."
...
..
...
# Maximum number of inbound peers
max_num_inbound_peers = 0

# Maximum number of outbound peers to connect to, excluding persistent peers
max_num_outbound_peers = 0
...
..
...
pex = false
```

These changes will force your validator to only connect to the `persistent_peers` that you've listed.  You no longer want to use the seeds as you cannot control their `private_peer_ids` settings.  Disabling `pex` will prevent you from telling others about yourself, and make your sentry's do that for you.

### Deploy your changes

It's now time to deploy your changes!

- Make sure all your Sentry's are live, running, and are all caught up!
- Make sure each Sentry has been configured properly to connect to your validator (check node ID and ip addresses!)
- Restart your validator and watch the logs!

```bash
systemctl restart vidulum && journalctl -u vidulum -f
```
